If you are short on time please do the last one (set your python path to SMRT). None of these are obligatory - these are just tools that may make your life easier in the long run so worth pursuing.

- clone this repository and let me know your GitHub ID (if you haven't) so I can add you as a collaborator (this will allow you to contribute and do the next step). If you have already cloned it, do 'git pull' to get the latest changes

- add a 1-line lyric to the lyrics.txt file and push it to the repository. To do this (use conda terminal)
	git pull
	(change file)
	git add lyrics.txt
	git commit
	git push

	if you encounter an error message or something you're not sure of, please post as an 'issue' in the GitHub repository [Issues>New issue (green button)]. Feel free to answer any of the issues too.

- have a look at the numpyetc.ipynb for common imports you're likely to use
- have a look at the ErrorChallenge.ipynb - can you solve the bugs?
- have a look at error.pdf - this flow chart may help you interpret those error messages
- have a look at pandas_nb.ipynb - this gives an introduction to data manipulation by importing a .csv with snowpit data
- set your python path. 

	On a mac, add this to your .profile (check for hidden files - it may exist or you can just create a text file with the name .profile if not):
		export PYTHONPATH="the/path/to/your/smrt" <- replace this with where you put SMRT

	On windows:


    		Go to settings, search for 'edit the system environment variables'
    		Click on 'Environment Variables'
    		Create new system variable
    		Name it PYTHONPATH
    		Enter or browse to the path to your SMRT directory

	Restart your computer then you should be able to run a jupyter notebook and just type
		
		import smrt
	

	Come along to the module room on Thursday 1pm if this doesn't work!
